If you want to test the design out, use GitHub's download repo feature to download it as a zip, extract the contents of the zip into one folder, and just open up any of the .html files! Ideally, start with index.html, but all the files should have traces to every other file. 
If you use uBlockOrigin, the design will break as uBO is active on files too, so you will need to either temporarily turn it off or manually turn it off on every page. 

There are two parts:
- DB-related stuff:
  This is the first part of the project, I wanted to create some basic templates for my friend's upcoming website, these templates are the random and sequential insert, alongside going back to the start, and going back to the previously looked at number for the sequential, and being able to never repeat numbers for the random insertions
- Image expansion/shrinking:
  My first attempt at creating code that would allow an image that was clicked to shrink/expand, alongside allowing the user to download the image, and to go to the next/previous images.

Both are accessible through their respective files (index.html for DB and imgExpand.html for image)
